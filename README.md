# Introduction 
ðŸ“Š Welcome to my SQL portfolio project, where I'm looking at the data job market, with a particular focus on data analyst positions. This project is a personal exploration aimed at training me in data analysis. 
The project itself consisted in identifying the highest-paying jobs, the most in-demand skills and the intersection between high demand and high pay in the field of data analysis.
